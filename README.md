# OpenPose-pose-estimation

This project performs human pose-estimation using a OpenPose model which is pretrained on COCO dataset. This program detects the key-points on human body and draws body skeleton. It also analyzed the efficiency and level of accuracy of this OpenPose model, plotting the graphic relationship between confidence levels and errors of each output.
